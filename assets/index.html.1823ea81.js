We have attempted to start from zero and lead the average person into the world of FreeBSD, fully referencing the FreeBSD Handbook and building a complete, scientific catalog system. This book is not a hodgepodge of tutorials or a collection of tutorials, but rather an open source book designed to build a self-contained system. The book is divided into thirty chapters, emphasizing the fundamentals necessary for learning FreeBSD as well as providing specialized tutorials on kernel design and implementation. This book can be used as a textbook for undergraduate students in the &quot;FreeBSD Operating System&quot; course in higher education, as well as for graduate students or computer technicians in related fields.</p><h3 id="open-source-maintenance-and-donations" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#open-source-maintenance-and-donations" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Open Source Maintenance and Donations</h3><p><img src="'+h+'" alt=""></p>',7),I={href:"https://freebsdfoundation.org/donate",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},A=t("Click here to donate to the FreeBSD Foundation"),q=t("In order to be able to maintain this book better, we have used the Gitbook platform for collaboration and Vuepress to present the book.

Some may feel that this is a waste of time, but without the nurturing of new talent, what would FreeBSD be tomorrow? Who doesn&#39;t know that newcomers may have many bad habits.</p><p>As Mr. Lu Xun said, may each person be a beam of light to illuminate the glorious thorny path of FreeBSD&#39;s advancement in mainland China. I also hope that you can join us to form a starry sky or a glowing fire.</p><p>The infinite distant lands, the countless people, are all related to me.</p><p>I have looked into the distant mountains countless times, trying to find a clear spring, but the sky is always not as it should be, still not found.</p><p>Who are we? Where did we come from? Where are we going? These questions will never be answered.</p><p>We chose FreeBSD because we wanted a clear, unambiguous, reliable, and solid operating system that would bring us profit in our work and pleasure in our lives. Of course there are still many problems with FreeBSD that need to be actively discovered, explored, and improved. Society is progressing, technology is advancing, enthusiasm is continuing unabated, and the future is getting better and better.</p><h3 id="blacklisting" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#blacklisting" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Blacklisting</h3><p>We encountered many difficulties in building the FreeBSD Chinese community: some Arch linux cultists provoked us by saying &quot;Arch is awesome! There were also some people who had never used BSD before, saying that there was no JAVA, no JNI, and no Eclipse in FreeBSD; there were also some Huawei fans who entered the community and tried to start an infighting by using Android&#39;s Hongmeng system as a shell. For the community, we have established a blacklist system.</p><p>The list is as follows.</p><h4 id="_2018-2021" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2018-2021" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2018-2021</h4><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:center;">QQ number</th><th style="text-align:center;">reason for blacklisting</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:center;">3623404390</td><td style="text-align:center;">Kick down the ladder, get the answer to the question and withdraw from the group, the same below</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center;">554412630</td><td style="text-align:center;">The administrator gave every student facing the college entrance exam a college entrance exam gift package (permission to the end of the exam) on the eve of the exam in order to prepare for the exam at ease, but he withdrew from the group to avoid permission</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center;">1354998</td><td style="text-align:center;">Insult BSD and promote Linux</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center;">156798543</td><td style="text-align:center;">Provoking trouble</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center;">1113749776</td><td style="text-align:center;">Huawei fan</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center;">2151722905</td><td style="text-align:center;">Enter the group babbling and pretending to be new, pretending to be stupid, name is database, suspected of being an artificial intelligence, good at asking some messy patchwork of non-existent questions: such as ``assembly language between c languages, there is a language.

This function name, why does not appear in this record line? Is the function name omitted? Does it take this table as a parameter? Does it use the data stream of this table as a parameter? In a broader view, programming languages can construct algebra and geometry. I just haven&#39;t thought it through yet. <code>and</code> framework, what is it? Are they devices? Looking at vue pairs, is it a device? Why, if you go to a computer store, you can buy cpu, memory sticks, and disks.

Traditional interpretations of functions may be wrong. Practicality Feasibility masks crudeness absurdity. In all likelihood, it is only right for functions to disable names and functions to disable comments. (However, the pragmatic view does not allow this nowadays).
