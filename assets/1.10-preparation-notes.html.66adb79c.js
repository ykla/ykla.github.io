However, it is important to understand that this is for convenience only, not that you cannot install using either ports or pkg or that you must install using one of the two.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Please note that ports is generally a HEAD branch, and it is best to keep your pkg on the same mainline as ports, i.e. both select <code>latest</code>.</strong></p></blockquote><h2 id="the-meaning-of-the-symbols-before-the-commands-in-this-book" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-meaning-of-the-symbols-before-the-commands-in-this-book" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The meaning of the symbols before the commands in this book</h2><p><code>#</code> means operation under <code>root</code>, same as <code>sudo</code>.</p><p><code>$</code> for general user privileges</p><h2 id="requirements-for-users" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#requirements-for-users" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Requirements for users</h2><p>The difficulty benchmark is based on the level of pass or above that can be achieved by an average undergraduate of computer science and technology in higher education institutions.
