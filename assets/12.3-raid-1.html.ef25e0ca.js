When the main hard disk is damaged, the mirror hard disk works instead of the main hard disk.</p><p><strong>RAID1 data recovery:</strong> If any disk is damaged, you can immediately recover data from the mirror disk. For example, if the above figure <code>Disk0</code> is damaged resulting in data loss, we can replace the failed disk with a new disk, read the data from <code>Disk1</code>, and copy it to the new disk, thus achieving data recovery.</p><p><strong>Application Scenario:</strong> RAID 1 is used in applications that require high sequential read/write performance and attach great importance to data protection. For example: servers, database storage field.</p><p><strong>Minimum number of drives:</strong> Minimum 2 drives required to create RAID 1</p><p><strong>Available Capacity:</strong> The actual number of available drives is half of the total number of drives</p>',7),s=[o];function d(n,c){return a(),r("div",null,s)}var m=e(i,[["render",d],["__file","12.3-raid-1.html.vue"]]);export{m as default};
