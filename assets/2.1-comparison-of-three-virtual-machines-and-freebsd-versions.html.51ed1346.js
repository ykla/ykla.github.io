After installation, you need to add <code>kern.maxphys=65536</code> to <code>/boot/loader.conf</code> to avoid repeating the operation every time you turn on the computer. After Aliyun upgrade is finished, you may get stuck in the boot screen due to such problem, so you need to reboot and enter VNC to do the above operation again.</p><p>Reference link: https://wiki.freebsd.org/SystemTuning</p>',17);function b(f,g){const o=n("ExternalLinkIcon");return s(),i("div",null,[c,t("p",null,[h,t("a",p,[u,d(o)]),y]),m])}var x=a(l,[["render",b],["__file","2.1-comparison-of-three-virtual-machines-and-freebsd-versions.html.vue"]]);export{x as default};
