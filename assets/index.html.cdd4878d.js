We have attempted to start from zero and lead the average person into the world of FreeBSD, fully referencing the FreeBSD Handbook and building a complete, scientific catalog system. This book is not a hodgepodge of tutorials or a collection of tutorials, but rather an open source book designed to build a self-contained system. The book is divided into thirty chapters, emphasizing the fundamentals necessary for learning FreeBSD as well as providing specialized tutorials on kernel design and implementation. This book can be used as a textbook for undergraduate students in the &quot;FreeBSD Operating System&quot; course in higher education, as well as for graduate students or computer technicians in related fields.</p><h3 id="open-source-maintenance-and-donations" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#open-source-maintenance-and-donations" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Open Source Maintenance and Donations</h3><p><img src="'+h+'" alt=""></p>',7),A={href:"https://freebsdfoundation.org/donate",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},q=t("Click here to donate to the FreeBSD Foundation"),G=t("In order to be able to maintain this book better, we have used the Gitbook platform for collaboration and Vuepress to present the book.

Some may feel that this is a waste of time, but without the nurturing of new talent, what would FreeBSD be tomorrow? Who doesn&#39;t know that newcomers may have many bad habits.</p><p>As Mr. Lu Xun said, may each person be a beam of light to illuminate the glorious thorny path of FreeBSD&#39;s advancement in mainland China. I also hope that you can join us to form a starry sky or a glowing fire.</p><p>The infinite distant lands, the countless people, are all related to me.</p><p>I have looked into the distant mountains countless times, trying to find a clear spring, but the sky is always not as it should be, still not found.</p><p>Who are we? Where did we come from? Where are we going? These questions will never be answered.</p><p>We chose FreeBSD because we wanted a clear, unambiguous, reliable, and solid operating system that would bring us profit in our work and pleasure in our lives. Of course there are still many problems with FreeBSD that need to be actively discovered, explored, and improved. Society is progressing, technology is advancing, enthusiasm is continuing unabated, and the future is getting better and better.</p>',9);function Q(Z,Y){const o=i("ExternalLinkIcon");return s(),d("div",null,[c,u,e("blockquote",null,[f,e("p",null,[e("strong",null,[p,e("a",m,[b,a(o)]),g])]),e("p",null,[_,e("a",k,[v,a(o)]),w,e("a",y,[F,a(o)]),S])]),D,e("p",null,[e("a",B,[x,a(o)])]),T,e("p",null,[e("a",A,[q,a(o)])]),e("p",null,[G,e("a",M,[O,a(o)]),W]),I,z,e("p",null,[e("a",L,[C,a(o)])]),E,e("p",null,[P,e("a",V,[j,a(o)]),N]),R,e("p",null,[X,e("a",H,[K,a(o)]),U]),J])}var ee=n(l,[["render",Q],["__file","index.html.vue"]]);export{ee as default};
