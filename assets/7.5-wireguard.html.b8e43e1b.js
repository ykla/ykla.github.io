It aims to be faster, simpler, leaner and more useful than IPsec, while avoiding a lot of headaches. It is intended to perform much better than OpenVPN. WireGuard is designed to be a general-purpose VPN that can run on embedded interfaces and supercomputers for many different situations. It was originally released for the Linux kernel and is now cross-platform (Windows, macOS, BSD, iOS, Android) and widely deployable. It is currently under heavy development, but is already considered the most secure, easiest to use, and simplest VPN solution in the industry.</p><p>Recommended for FreeBSD 13, install:</p><div class="language-text ext-text line-numbers-mode"><pre class="language-text"><code># pkg install wireguard
